Josh Samani's script for grading ranking tasks

Some updates made by Jared

* Updated to work for an answer string of any length
* Now prompts the grader for input
* Runs in an infinite loop so that the script need not be rerun for every student
* Warns the grader if the student answer is not a rearrangement of the correct answer
